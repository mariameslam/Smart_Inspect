Smart Quality Control: A solution that uses AI-enabled cameras and IoT devices to monitor the manufacturing process and identify defects in real-time. The system could use machine learning algorithms to analyze images captured by cameras throughout the manufacturing process, and automatically flag any defects or anomalies. This would help to reduce the time and cost associated with manual quality control processes, and improve product quality and consistency.

The VIT (Vision Transformer) technology has been implemented on the casting product image data for quality inspection Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ravirajsinh45/real-life-industrial-dataset-of-casting-product?datasetId=487456&sortBy=voteCount

Overview: Smart Quality Control is a solution that uses AI-enabled cameras and IoT devices to monitor the manufacturing process and identify defects in real-time. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze images captured by cameras throughout the manufacturing process, and automatically flag any defects or anomalies. This helps to reduce the time and cost associated with manual quality control processes, and improve product quality and consistency.

How it works: • The Smart Quality Control system is installed in the manufacturing facility, with cameras and sensors strategically placed throughout the production line. • The cameras capture images of the products as they move through the production line, and send them to the AI system for analysis. • The AI system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the images in real-time, looking for defects such as cracks, dents, and scratches. • If a defect is detected, the system sends an alert to the quality control team, who can then investigate and take appropriate action. • The system can also learn over time, using the data from previous inspections to improve its accuracy and reduce false positives.

Benefits: • Faster and more efficient quality control: The Smart Quality Control system can analyze images in real-time, enabling defects to be detected and addressed quickly. This reduces the need for manual inspection, which can be time-consuming and costly. • Improved product quality and consistency: By identifying defects early in the production process, the Smart Quality Control system can help to improve product quality and consistency, reducing the likelihood of defects reaching the customer. • Cost savings: By reducing the need for manual inspection, the Smart Quality Control system can help to save on labor costs. In addition, by catching defects early, it can reduce the cost of rework and waste. • Data-driven insights: The system can generate data on the types and frequency of defects, which can be used to identify areas for improvement in the manufacturing process. This can help to optimize processes and reduce defects over time.
